## Purpose of Project ##
Application of Depth Limit Search Algorithm on Facebook Friend Connection dataset.


## Result ##
Upon the action of the algorithm on the dataset the user will be able to find friend connections up-to a limit (l)

For instance,

if l = 2

  Result => Friends of Friends


if l = 3

  Result => Friends of Friends of Friends

and so on....

## TODOs ##

- [x] Understand the basic framework of the dataset
- [x] Implement Algorithm on the dataset
- [x] Publish applicable results in the form of graphs with appropriate parameters
- [x] Development of a proper UI showing traversal of each node with the progress of the algorithm
